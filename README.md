I'm a Masters of Computer Science Student at Banaras Hindu University. Passionate about Cybersecurity, DevOps and Tech Stuff. I loves to build scalable systems, web applications, and productivity tools.

As a tech enthusiast, I look forward to explore and learn new technologies and tinker with them. I enjoy working as an active open-source contributor.

I usually work on projects in my free time, find some of them on my GitHub.
